## Intro

With over 13 years of experience in web development, I bring a unique blend of mathematical problem-solving skills and technical prowess to every project.

My journey began on the frontend during the twilight of jQuery and the dawn of technologies like Backbone, NodeJS, and Grunt. Today, I’m a versatile full-stack developer. I thrive on translating product requirements into technical solutions.

My background in mathematics enables me to adapt to new technologies and solve complex problems efficiently and quickly. I’m a strong advocate for functional programming and believe in building small prototypes to test ideas early in the development process.

## Core competencies

### Backend development
10+ years of Ruby on Rails expertise. Plus, successfully launched a Golang project into production.

### Frontend development
Proficient in React, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript frameworks like NextJS.

### Full-stack integration
Skilled in GraphQL for seamless frontend-backend integration.

### Emerging technologies
Recently looked into Elixir & Phoenix LiveView for cutting-edge full-stack development.

### AI & mechanistic interpretability

Completed AI Alignment course by BlueDot Impact and was awarded *Best Interactive Deliverable* for final project - [click here][activate-love-bluedot] to view the project.

### No/low-code & rapid prototyping

Adept at leveraging no-code tools like Bubble.io, Airtable, and Retool for quick MVP development.

## Project experience

From working with founders to build their first MVPs to delivering high-priority features for larger companies, I’ve successfully contributed to a diverse range of projects. My experience spans:

* Prototype development for startup founders
* MVP creation for new ventures
* High-priority roadmap item delivery for established companies
* Pure backend/API development
* Full-circle frontend and backend integration
* Enabling and empowering internal teams, e.g., by
    * kick-starting major projects and seamlessly integrating internal staff
    * providing technical consultation on solutions utilizing existing resources
    * offering ongoing support and guidance during implementation, often in an advisory capacity

My approach not only delivers immediate results but also enhances the capabilities of in-house teams, fostering long-term success and self-sufficiency for the teams I work with.

Below are some client engagements that showcase this approach in action.

## Clients

A few of the companies I've partnered with:

### [BlueDot Impact](https://bluedot.org)

_»Industry-leading free AI courses and career support.«_

Collaborated with a distributed team across London, Berlin, and San Francisco to relaunch their website. Delivered MVP on schedule with excellent project coordination from BlueDot's team. The foundation I laid continues to evolve and serve their mission today—more [details on the homepage](/#work-from-bluedot-impact).

Tech: Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS.

### [XING Marketing Solutions][xms]

_»Successful campaigns with XING—reach your target audience in a business environment with excellent data quality.«_

Tech: Ruby on Rails, Golang, TypeScript, React, GraphQL.

### [Deepwave](https://www.deepwave.org/)

_»The ocean conservation organization, giving the ocean a voice.«_

Guided Deepwave's team in launching one of their initiatives with a lightweight Jamstack approach instead of WordPress. Handled initial setup and complex integrations, enabling them to build and maintain their platform independently—see the result at [klartext.deepwave.org](https://klartext.deepwave.org/).

Tech: Jamstack, Hugo, Git-backed CMS

### [Dividat](https://dividat.com/)

_»Interactive & evidence-based training concepts. A Unique Approach to
Cognitive-Motor Training.«_

Brought a game from prototype to production for the Dividat Play platform, designed for their Senso hardware. Benefited from exceptional groundwork by their internal team. Close-knit communication made for efficient development and deployment.

Tech: JavaScript, AWS

## Working style

As a remote worker, I prioritize focused deep work and asynchronous communication. However, I’m always ready to engage in valuable synchronous discussions when needed and enjoy participating in kick-off workshops or team meetings in person when possible. Most days, I operate out of my office in beautiful Lübeck, Germany.

## Logistics

My time commitment is tailored to each project’s unique needs. For focused projects, I typically dedicate 2-3 person-days (8 hours each) spread across 3-4 days per week. I’m also available for more minor consulting-type engagements, which might involve only one or two calls per month. This flexibility allows me to accommodate various project scales and client needs, ensuring I can provide the right level of attention and expertise to each engagement.

## Previous employments

### [tevim.com](https://tevim.com)

_October 2017 - December 2019_

_»Digitalization is an opportunity. We use its potential for meaningful change.«_

Roles: Full Stack Developer. Project Manager. Business Strategist. Sales Agent. Marketeer.

During my time at tevim, we were a tight-knit agency/team of five experienced software developers, so everybody had the opportunity (and responsibility) to chip in on different roles. There was a lot of room for personal development and knowledge sharing all whilst working very closely with a range of different customers.

I led workshops for distilling the product value proposition to work on in the early stages of web software MVPs.

Together with our customers we built MVPs of brand-new product ideas and ported existing legacy web systems to the modern _mobile_ world.

### [tolingo](https://www.tolingo.com)

_May 2014 - September 2017_

_»t for translation. Professional translations into any world language.«_

Role: Full Stack Developer.

At tolingo I had the opportunity to grow from a Frontend / JavaScript engineer to a full-fledged Full Stack Developer using Ruby on Rails.

We were a small team of 2-3 engineers working on the internal software stack and the customer-facing web-shop.

I worked very closely with our stakeholders to enable the team of sales agents, translation project managers, and translators to deliver high-quality results efficiently through our custom-built software solutions.

### [ePages](https://epages.com)

_April 2012 - April 2014_

_»Create your online shop in the cloud.«_

Role: Frontend Developer.

ePages was my first professional engagement in the world of web software. I was eager to get out of the theoretical world of pure mathematics academia and I succeeded in picking up the tools and practices of web development very fast thanks to my strong basis in rational problem-solving.

We moved the existing frontend stack to the leading frontend stack of the time. Also, I was part of a spear-heading team that led the way to an all-new version of the software while implementing agile practices into the work-flow.

## Education
