# Hi, I'm Jan – a full-stack developer helping teams turn *ambitious ideas* into *elegant code* & *ship it*™. <br><span class="ship"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-sailboat-icon lucide-sailboat"><path d="M22 18H2a4 4 0 0 0 4 4h12a4 4 0 0 0 4-4Z"/><path d="M21 14 10 2 3 14h18Z"/><path d="M10 2v16"/></svg></span>

I started my career in software 14+ years ago on the frontend. Quickly, I acquired backend skills to be able to ship complete features end-to-end.

In a previous life, 14+ years ago, I was a mathematician. It shows in how I approach problems – I love diving deep into complex challenges and finding elegant solutions.

I’ve been consulting as a full-stack developer for over 5 years. Remote since before it was cool, I’ve learned that the best products are built on trust, clear communication, and testing ideas early.

Curious about my work? [Read on](#work-from-bluedot-impact) to find out about some of my projects, or [check my resume][resume] for all the nitty-gritty details.

## Work from BlueDot Impact

I collaborated with [BlueDot](https://bluedot.org/), a nonprofit organization in the AI security space, to relaunch their website. My role was to lay the groundwork for the MVP to be built on time while building a solid foundation for BlueDot's future endeavors.

This engagement included

* Integrating their design system using [Storybook](https://storybook.k8s.bluedot.org) & [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
* Introducing a [staging -> production workflow](https://github.com/bluedotimpact/bluedot/tree/master/apps/website#deployment),
* Researching current Design <-> Dev feedback loop enhancements leveraging AI technologies.

All while closely collaborating with the internal team & a group of externals.

We shipped the MVP on schedule while building a foundation that the team still uses today. Did I mention all their code is [open source](https://github.com/bluedotimpact/bluedot)?

Tech: Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS

## Work from XING Marketing Solutions

Over the past several years, I've worked extensively with [XING Marketing Solutions][xms], a subsidiary of [XING][xing] that delivers marketing solutions on the XING platform to agency customers.

This collaboration included

* Spearheading the development of key product features—often as the first developer on projects, working closely with the product team before scaling up with additional engineers, and
* Tackling impactful architectural restructurings, notably migrating from a fragmented microservices architecture to a much more practical monolith-focused solution,

While I've witnessed natural changes in both team composition and technical approaches over the years, the consistent quality of collaboration and the meaningful impact of our work together have made this one of my most valued long-term professional relationships.

Tech: Ruby on Rails, Golang, TypeScript, React, GraphQL

## Passion Projects

I am a huge open source enthusiast. My oldest open source work at this point is [Tab Ahead](https://github.com/janraasch/tab-ahead). A browser extension for finding that one crucial tab to return to in a sea of open tabs & windows. I released it back in 2013. Many browsers do a pretty good job of this themselves nowadays, but Tab Ahead still has a user base of a couple of hundred people.

I also maintain two Hugo themes. [Hugo Bear Blog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) recently reached 1000 stars on GitHub and focuses on fast, simple blogging without the bloat - it powers this website as well. [Hugo Product Launch](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-product-launch) is a clean single-page theme for startups, featuring a neat landing page with built-in contact forms.

My latest invention is [ʕ •ᴥ• ʔ Bear Feed](https://github.com/janraasch/v0-bearfeed). It’s the essence of a social feed: Posts (with optional Photos), Comments, and Likes. No notifications. Plus, everything is deleted after a couple of days. The current implementation is built with v0 on Vercel & Supabase. However, I might reimplement this in Rails one day. Let me know, if you'd like to see that.
