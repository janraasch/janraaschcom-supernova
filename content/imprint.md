### Controller and contact information

### Collected data

To operate my website, I have to collect and process some personal data. In the following sections, I will explain exactly which data is concerned and when and how I am collecting and processing it.

Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.

I do not use any kind of automated profiling to serve this website.

### Automatically collected data

As usual when browsing the internet, some information about your connection will be stored on the servers that host the website. That information includes your browser type and version, operating system used, the origin of your visit ("referrer"), the exact page requested, your IP address, your country and configured language and the time of your visit.

This website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (a service by Netlify, Inc., California, USA) and you can refer to [their privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/) if you'd like to learn more.

The basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.

### Data that you provide

If you contact me (e.g. by email, contact form), your message may contain personal data. I will use this data exclusively to answer your message. You do not have to provide any data to contact me, so the disclosure of this data is completely voluntary for you.

Affected data: The data you include in your message

Lawful basis: The storage is based on our legitimate interest in replying to your message in accordance with Art. 6(1) lit. f GDPR.

### What rights do you have regarding your data?

You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge. You also have the right to request that it be corrected, blocked, or deleted. You can contact me at any time using the address given in the legal notice if you have further questions about the issue of privacy and data protection. You may also, of course, file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.

#### Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before I receive your request may still be legally processed.

#### Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities

If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation is the data protection officer of the German state in which my business is headquartered. A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the following link: https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html.

#### Right to data portability

You have the right to have data which I process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.

#### Information, blocking, deletion

As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed. You also have the right to have this data corrected, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in our legal notice if you have further questions on the topic of personal data.
